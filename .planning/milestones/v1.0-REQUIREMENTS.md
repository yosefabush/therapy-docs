- **EAIF-02**: Golden Thread linking insights to treatment plan goals
- **EAIF-03**: Multidisciplinary synthesis across different therapist perspectives
- **EAIF-04**: Predictive alerts for risk patterns

### Safety & Compliance

- **SAFE-01**: Visual AI attribution distinguishing AI vs human content
- **SAFE-02**: Audit trail logging AI generation, approvals, modifications
- **SAFE-03**: Hallucination guardrails grounding output in session data only

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Role selection for summaries | Therapist's own role auto-determines prompt; prevents misuse |
| Manual editing of AI summaries | Regenerate-only keeps output consistent |
| Role-specific patient insights | Unified view serves multi-therapist collaboration |
| Real-time/automatic generation | On-demand only for v1; avoids surprise AI content |
| Session summary on insights page | Lives on session page only for context |

## Traceability

|-------------|-------|--------|
| SUMM-01 | Phase 2 | Complete |
| SUMM-02 | Phase 3 | Complete |
| SUMM-03 | Phase 2 | Complete |
| SUMM-04 | Phase 1 | Complete |
| SUMM-05 | Phase 3 | Complete |
